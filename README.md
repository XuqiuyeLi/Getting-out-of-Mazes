# Getting-out-of-Mazes
**Project details**: Implement stack and queue collections to find the way out of mazes and write unit tests for both classes.


## Program Usage
* The program is started with two command line arguments (you can either run it in a terminal or in an IDE, like Eclipse, as long as there is a way of specifying the command line arguments for the program).

* If the program is run with fewer than two arguments, it is an error (the program prints an error message and terminates).

* If the program is run with more than two arguments, the additional arguments are ignored.

* The first command line argument is a name of an input file containing a maze to be used by the program. (This project comes with two such files. You can (and should) create your own mazes for testing.) The name of the file can be entered as an absolute or relative path.

* The second command line argument is one of the following keywords: stack or queue. If any other keyword is used, the program
prints a message indicated that this option is not supported. (The meaning of the two keywords is described below.)
